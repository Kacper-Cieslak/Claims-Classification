# Car Insurance Claim Prediction ðŸš—

### Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a car insurance customer will make a claim. This is a binary classification problem, where the model learns to predict a value of 1 (the customer made a claim) or 0 (the customer did not make a claim) based on various customer and driving behavior features.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Car Insurance Data" from Kaggle.
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagnik1511/car-insurance-data/data

### Size: The dataset contains 10,000 observations and 19 columns, including 18 feature variables and one target variable.

Objective
The primary goal is to create a robust predictive model that helps the insurance company better understand customer behavior and assess risk. This can lead to more personalized offers and optimized business strategies.
