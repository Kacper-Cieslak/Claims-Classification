# Car Insurance Claim Prediction ðŸš—

### Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a car insurance customer will make a claim. This is a binary classification problem, where the model learns to predict a value of 1 (the customer made a claim) or 0 (the customer did not make a claim) based on various customer and driving behavior features.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Car Insurance Data" from Kaggle.
The dataset contains 10,000 observations and 19 columns, including 18 feature variables and one target variable.

Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest were chosen for comparison because they represent a spectrum of machine learning approaches.
- Logistic Regression: A simple and fast linear benchmark model for initial performance evaluation.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-linear, distance-based model used to see if a more complex approach is needed.
- Random Forest: A powerful ensemble method known for high accuracy and robustness, chosen as a strong candidate for the final model.
